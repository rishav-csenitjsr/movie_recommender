## Movie Recommender System based on the MovieLens 100K dataset

A simple movie recommender system. Made a simple UI that just recommends a genre, for now.

Used:

* [KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html): to cluster similar movies together. 

* [Pearson Correlation Similarity Measure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient): to measure similarity between two users. 

Currently getting a Mean Squared Error of 1.23 on the test set.
